<em>(Spoilers follow for Twin Peaks. Avoid reading if you haven't watched the entire series & film.)</em>

<!-- more -->

So I'm working my way through the iTunes 720p versions of <em>Twin Peaks</em>. This is probably the fourth time watching the series as a whole (the first in HD) and I'm currently sitting on episode twelve of the second season with friends. I know things aren't great at this point and won't be until towards the end of the season but that first season still holds up extremely well. When Lynch and Frost had full control and kept the show moving along nicely.

I know once I make it through the series and watch the often maligned yet fantastic <em>Fire Walk With Me</em>, there are still many questions left unanswered.

## Twin Peaks - Season 3

So it begs the question of a third season or a remake. For years, fans (and there are still [many passionate ones out there](http://www.twinpeaksfest.com)) have hoped that a third season would eventuate but David Lynch has been adamant about not wanting to return to the brilliant mythology he and Mark Frost created 23-24 years ago. I couldn't get aboard a remake but a third season seems to make much more sense, especially since it's nearly 25 years since Laura told Cooper she would see him again.

So is a third season likely? In the past, I would have said "Never!" mainly because Lynch has vehemently denied wanting a third season. There are many theories as to why Lynch wouldn't want to continue the show himself but after the treatment by the networks on the original run of the show and other failed pilots, network TV wouldn't be that enticing. Lynch loves control over this work (he always has), and of course, in most TV settings, you don't get that full control. In January of this year a return to <em>Twin Peaks</em> was [flat out denied by Frost and Lynch](http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/news/david-lynch-no-twin-peaks/).  However in May, Lynch told actor Ray Wise (Leyland Palmer) that ["Well, Ray, you know, the town is still there. And I suppose it's possible that we could revisit it..."](http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/news/david-lynch-revisit-twin-peaks/). 

That last bit of info is perhaps a turning of the tide for Lynch. Perhaps he is thinking of revisiting the little town and its inhabitants as the mythology is both well loved and rich. Even more encouraging is that Lynch recently followed <em>Peaks</em> co-creator Mark Frost on Twitter. Perhaps they are planning a third season or another series entirely. But maybe this is just wishful thinking.

However, things seem to be aligning for something and here's why I think it makes absolute sense to see a third season in the near future:

### Cable networks are the perfect new home

If you think about it, the first season of <em>Twin Peaks</em> was eight episodes of near perfection. Bold (at the time), hilarious, tightly scripted, terrifying and ground-breaking. Lynch and Frost were in full control. In today's TV landscape, the best shows are on the cable networks - HBO, AMC, Showtime, and Netflix.

If I had to choose a new home, I think Netflix feels right. Hot on the heels of original series such as <em>Orange is the New Black</em> and <em>House of Cards</em>, they seem to be the place where interesting original material is being produced and show creators get control. They gave the creators of <em>Arrested Development</em> full control on the new season (albeit with questionable results) and even the Chief Content Officer at Netflix said ["Absolutely!"](http://welcometotwinpeaks.com/news/netflix-bring-back-twin-peaks/) when asked if they would help bring the show back. They also have the first two seasons of the show available to watch immediately so it must be tracking well with their audience.

Eight to thirteen episodes of a new season on Netflix. If there's more story to tell, go for additional shorter seasons.

### Give Lynch and Frost full control

<p class="extra-large"><img class="cols-eight" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/journal/twin-peaks-lynch-frost-on-set.jpg" alt="David Lynch and Mark Frost on the set of Twin Peaks"></p>

This is essentially a no-brainer and why somewhere like Netflix is a great home for a third season. When Lynch was in the directors chair of any <em>Twin Peaks</em> episode, he elevated the show beyond the soap opera. Take away that control, you end up losing Lynch and it's a potential repeat of the second season silliness. Lynch brought his signature darkness and surrealism to the show that just can't be matched by another director. You don't want someone else doing Lynch either. It has to come from him personally. The world is his and Frost's so trust in them completely and watch the viewers climb.

### Bring back SOME older characters, introduce new ones

Being realistic here, many of the original actors of the show are either too old or dead. Bob is relatively easy to replace, Kyle MacLachlan however needs to come back in some form to give a little more closure. But in Lynch and Frost I trust with that one. I think wrapping a few things up (sorry, bad pun!) within an episode or two from the second season and fast-forward a little into the future with new characters is perhaps one way to keep things fresh without shitting on the old. Keep the town, the music, the mythology, some of the old central characters if possible, and move on from Laura Palmer fairly quickly. As much as I love the old cast, it was the mythology that really resonated for me and that is where the show reached greatness.

### Lynch has produced two solo albums and is possibly done with music for a while

Lynch has been busy lately with music - in particular his solo albums. But now that they have been released with varied success, perhaps he's happy to put that pursuit away for a while and focus more on visual storytelling. Of course, more collaboration with Angelo Badalamenti on new <em>Peaks</em> music is a given.

### Lynch and Frost gotta eat?

<p class="extra-large"><img class="cols-eight" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/journal/twin-peaks-on-set.jpg" alt="On set with the Giant"></p>

Well, perhaps they'll never go hungry and perhaps they don't care about the money side of things at all but neither of them have created anything on the same level of loyalty with an audience as the original show (okay Lynch's films are well loved enough). A new season is bound to rate well and bring in the money for the network and its creators, allowing them to fund future projects. By revisiting <em>Twin Peaks</em>, both Lynch and Frost can fuel their creativity and their bank balances and please old and new fans alike. Surely everyone wins?

### 2014 will be "I'll see you again in 25 years"

If the show took place around February 1989 (even though it aired in 1990), then 2014 will be the 25 years later and therefore, perfect timing for a new series to pick things up.

<hr>

### Closing Thoughts

So there you have it. If the show ever returns, now is the perfect time to return to the Red Room, the Black (and White) Lodge, Owls, Giants, Dwarfs, the town, the music, some of the characters, and the genuinely fascinating, multi-layered mythology of a truly influential series. The fans deserve it, there is plenty left to tell, the show has such a cult following, it would easily reach <em>Game of Thrones</em> like success and we finally get Lynch back to doing what we love him doing best - visual storytelling that fucks with our minds and takes us to a place both wonderful and strange.
