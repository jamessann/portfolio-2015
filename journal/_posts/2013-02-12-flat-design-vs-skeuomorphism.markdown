excerpt: Flat Design vs Skeuomorphism
---
French designer [Sacha Greif](http://sachagreif.com/) may have just encapsulated the current endless debate on 'Flat Design vs Skeuomorphism' in the digital design world with his excellent post [Flat Pixels: The Battle between Flat Design & Skeuomorphism](http://sachagreif.com/flat-pixels).

In his summary, he notes:

> I believe that until our tools catch up with what the web has to offer, we'll have to get our hands dirty and start coding. And when you're both designing and coding a layout, you start to appreciate the value of keeping things lightweight.

This really resonated with me having designed and built a number of responsive sites myself (or been involved in the collaborative process). I'm not saying you're a better digital designer if you can code as well but you certainly appreciate other factors which go into making the best possible product for the end user such as performance and usability first-hand.  And when you do, flat aesthetics often shake up your design approach and give you room to grow.
