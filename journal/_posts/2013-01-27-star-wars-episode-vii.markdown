So JJ Abrams is [officially on board](http://starwars.com/news/star-wars-is-being-kick-started-with-dynamite-jj-abrams-to-direct-star-wars-episode-vii.html) to direct Episode VII and the first of a new trilogy is set to burst onto the big screen in 2015. The general consensus within the geek community is he's probably the best man for the job. Well liked, an impressive filmography thus far and the closest we'll ever get to having a Spielberg directed "Star Wars".  Abrams has demonstrated in films such as "Super 8" and "Star Trek" that he can successfully juggle character development, engaging stories and characters, and direct action sequences with momentum and good old-fashioned "Hells yeah!" reactions.

The decision by Disney is also the safest. No matter what happens, the film is bound to be better than Episodes I - III and with that, the box office and associated product lines will break records and make a lot of people very wealthy. It's sure to please young and older fans of the series alike and get the long-running saga back on track. Heck - we might even get something as classic and timeless as "A New Hope". That's a mighty good possibility.

So here's my run-down of how I see Episode VII unfolding with Abrams behind the wheel:

Ultimately, more of the swashbuckling adventure prevalent in the original trilogy. The best thing about a true sequel or new series of "Star Wars" films is it gives us back the elements of surprise. Anything is possible and there are no real restrictions. With the prequels, Lucas was trapped giving us everything we already knew.  Abrams and his team have the ability to give us more of those amazing "I am your father!" moments, to shock, to excite, to surprise. Abrams loves [The Mystery Box](http://www.ted.com/talks/j_j_abrams_mystery_box.html) elements of storytelling so since 1983, you'll have no idea how it will all play out.  Rumours of the original cast and characters appearing in one way or another will be there no doubt and I'm throwing out a wild guess that a Han Solo type will be heavily featured throughout the new trilogy. With Yoda's passing in "Return of the Jedi", it will be interesting to see how they'll work him or another of his race in too.

Tonally, older fans (that's me) are pining for more of the original trilogy and that's probably where they're going to take the series. Lucas gave younger fans an epic slice of cheese with the prequels and it's time fans got something that will resonate with young and old. The scenes when Luke first meets Yoda and trains in "The Empire Strikes Back" are pure sci-fi theatre - the slow discovery, the build up, the wonder. Abrams (and screenwriter Michael Arndt) get this and this has me quite excited.  Abrams has quoted his love of the original trilogy in the past:

> "Star Wars" is probably the most influential film of my generation. It's the personification of good and evil and the way it opened up the world to space adventure, the way westerns had to our parents' generations, left an indelible imprint. So, in a way, everything that any of us does is somehow directly or indirectly affected by the experience of seeing those first three films.

<h2 class="center">The Cast</h2>

<p class="extra-large"><img class="cols-eight" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/journal/star-wars-luke-leia-han.jpg" alt="Luke, Leia and Han"></p>

Lucas cast largely unknowns for major characters in his films so it will be interesting to see what Abrams does with new blood. Rumours of the original cast have been floating around, and I would hazard a guess that we're definitely going to get one or two featured. It is a continuation of the original trilogy so there's got to be some inclusion. Mark Hamill is my bet but it's way too early to say. To be honest, I don't know if I'd like to see an older Han and Leia on screen. But Luke becoming an "Obi Wan" figure somehow would fit. Of the new characters, I'd say relatively unknowns is likely to be the way.

<h2 class="center">The Visual Effects</h2>

As much as I'd like greater use of old school models, Abrams tends to rely heavily on CGI for most of his visual effects, at least thus far in his career. Depending on who makes up his visual effects team for Episode VII, you can guarantee they'll be top-notch regardless.  Looking at the trailer for the [new Star Trek](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEUN-8W-MgE), Abrams has a solid grasp on CGI and set-design. I'd imagine he'd push it even further for the new "Star Wars" film.  Long-time fans of course want puppets and models but realistically, that's probably not going to eventuate.

I tend to think he'll really dial back on his love of lens flares too just because they feel more at home for "Star Trek" than in "Star Wars". But I think they'll turn up every now and again.

I love Michael Giacchino but c'mon, it has to be John Williams. I don't really want Giacchino to 'do' Williams either. But that decision will be a mighty interesting one. Giacchino wrote additional scores for the [Star Tours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tours:_The_Adventures_Continue#Music) attraction so he has a little "Star Wars" experience and he has scored every Abrams film to date. John Williams' epic scores however are just as important as any character in the "Star Wars" universe and without his master touch, it just wouldn't be the same.

<h2 class="center">Closing Thoughts</h2>

Which ever way you feel, the prospect of a new "Star Wars" adventure that doesn't entirely suck and may actually be rather good, is exciting for any long-time fan. Abrams made me feel ten years old again when I watched "Super 8" and I'm hugely optimistic he'll knock it out of the park for those young and old audiences who've craved a decent "Star Wars" movie since 1983.  Maybe then, poor old George can be left alone and get a good nights rest on his four billion dollar king-sized bed.
