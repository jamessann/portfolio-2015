I came across a [fantastic article today from Paul Boag](https://boagworld.com/working-in-web/right-skills/) which I think speaks volumes about longevity in the digital realm. Paul talks about how technical skills whilst important now, may become redundant over time. He makes note of 'soft skills' and how they'll never be replaced by computers:

> "Many of the skills I learnt 20 years ago when I started in the web are now redundant. The ones that have survived the test of time are these ‘soft skills’. If you are looking to build a robust career then focus on these rather than the latest innovation."

Personally, these 'soft skills' have been invaluable in the projects I have worked on and the teams and clients I have interacted with thus far in my career.
