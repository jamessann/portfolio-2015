excerpt: My most anticipated films of 2013
---
<p class="intro">Films, films, and more films.</p>

Despite being more a fan of cable TV shows these days (*Game of Thrones* - Season Three starting in a few days! Hells yeah!), there are a handful of potentially great films on the horizon this year. Those listed below are not big-budget sequels (Okay a couple are) or comic book franchises (okay one is) but for the most part, the following films represent some potential gems which have been getting a lot of early buzz from various film festivals around the world. This list is by no means complete and just a personal collection I find that preaches to my tastes (which hopefully you will find both eclectic and varied).

I left off most comic book franchises and larger popcorn flicks because I'll probably see those too. However, the following have a stronger potential to be in my Top 5 for 2013.

Release dates are approximate Australian releases and therefore are listed in (very) rough release date order.

<h2 class="no-padding">Trance</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY DANNY BOYLE</h5>

Any new Danny Boyle film is worth checking out and his newest is apparently a hark back to his earlier works such as “Shallow Grave”. Whilst I'm not a huge fan of James McAvoy, it also stars the fantastic Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson.  [Early reviews](http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=137863) have been positive and like any Danny Boyle film, it's sure to be an energetic, original and thrilling ride.  On a side note, Danny Boyle has [recently said he plans to direct the sequel to “Trainspotting”](http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/mar/11/danny-boyle-trainspotting-sequel) in 2016 based on the novel *Porno* with the original cast. Awesome indeed!

<h2 class="no-padding">Spring Breakers</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY HARMONY KORINE</h5>

The first of two stylistic films this year centering on out-of-control youth going on a crime spree.  However don't let the trailers or dubstep fool you. This has been getting some [decent reviews](http://movies.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/movies/spring-breakers-directed-by-harmony-korine.html?_r=0) and it's from the writer of “Kids” and director of “Gummo” so prepare to be thrown a curveball.  Starring a few ex-Disney girls wearing next to nothing and James Franco as a drug kingpin should keep things interesting and whilst that might not be everyone's cup of tea, it looks like a surreal, crazy experience to say the least.

<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY FEDE ALVAREZ</h5>

Rabid fans of the original and its sequels will probably never fully appreciate a remake on quite the same level but it was bound to happen. The fact that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell put their names to this is encouraging and the red-band trailer (linked below) puts this remake more in line with the tone of the original film &mdash; scary and bloody as hell. I love a scary, fun horror flick so I’m keen to check this one out. Original fans don’t need to despair though &mdash; Bruce Campbell is confident we’ll get [a sequel to the original trilogy in some shape or form sooner or later](http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=36976).

<h2 class="no-padding">This Is The End</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY SETH ROGEN, EVAN GOLDBERG</h5>

Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen wrote one of my favourite teen films of recent years - “Superbad” and they're back not just writing but also co-directing a comedy apocalyptic caper movie containing pretty much [every comedic actor in Hollywood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1245492/fullcredits) and a plethora of cameos. This looks like a lot of R-rated fun and as with most comedies, I hope it hits more than it misses.

<p class="extra-large"><img class="cols-ten" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/journal/af2013-elysium.jpg" alt="Elysium"></p>

<h2 class="no-padding">Elysium</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY NEILL BLOMKAMP</h5>

Neill Blomkamp’s futuristic follow-up to the much-loved “District 9” is sure to be just as exciting as his feature film debut with a great cast and a US$100 million budget at his disposal. It does feel quite similar to “District 9” in the sense that it's set in a desolate future, with an oppressive government furthering the social divide by setting up a space station called “Elysium” housing the wealthy and keeping the overpopulated Earth residents out. That is, until Matt Damon comes in and kicks ass. Jodie Foster also stars so this could be a perfect blend of action, sci-fi and drama.

######Release Date: AUGUST 15, 2013

<h2 class="no-padding">Kick-Ass 2</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY JEFF WADLOW</h5>

Speaking of kicking ass, *Kick-Ass* was a fantastic comic book movie for adults. It’s coarse, violent and great fun. I’m cautiously optimistic about *Kick-Ass 2* however. Ultimately because original director Matthew Vaughn isn’t on board this time around and he brought a kinetic thrill to the action in the original film which will be hard to top. The trailer looks promising but this one could go either way. It looks a little cheaper than the original too but with the inclusion of a barely recognisable Jim Carrey joining the cast, I’m sure it will have a decent mix of laughs and action to please fans.

<h2 class="no-padding">Gravity</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY ALFONSO CUARÓN</h5>

When Alfonso Cuarón attempts a space movie, you know it’s going to be all kinds of ambitious and grandiose. The director of “Children of Men” has been keeping us at bay in terms of footage from the film but early reports have pegged this one as a modern classic. The plot feels like a combination of "Moon" and "2001" but it's hopefully entirely different (in a good way). George Clooney and Sandra Bullock star. This could be my most anticipated film of the year purely because of Alfonso's vision.

######Release Date: OCTOBER 3, 2013

<h2 class="no-padding">The World's End</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY EDGAR WRIGHT</h5>

The third and final film in Edgar Wright’s “Blood and Ice-Cream Trilogy” sees Simon Pegg and Nick Frost attempt to out-do their epic pub crawl from twenty-years earlier only to discover the world might be ending that very night.  When these three get together, it's a pitch perfect blend of comedy, action and film references. I've seen "Shaun of the Dead" and "Hot Fuzz" multiple times so I shall be there opening night after I’ve been down the pub myself for a Guinness or two. Cheers!

<h2 class="no-padding">Before Midnight</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY RICHARD LINKLATER</h5>

Actually, sorry Alfonso. It looks like “Before Midnight” might be my most anticipated film of the year after all. When news hit that not only a new “Before” film would be released but that it had already finished filming, fans were either ecstatic or apprehensive. I leaned towards the former only because I love Jesse and Celine as characters, the very nature of how some aspects of people change over time whilst others remain the same. They are like old friends who you voyeuristically want to check in with every now and again and see how it all unfolds. Fascinating, romantic, tragic, the “Before” films are essential film experiences. Early word is this third film in the series is perhaps the best yet(!) so I will be there opening night (MIFF 2013 maybe?). I chose not to link to the just released trailer only because I want to go into this one without any further knowledge. But it’s out there if you can't wait.

######Release Date: 2nd - 3rd QTR 2013

<h2 class="no-padding">To The Wonder</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY TERRENCE MALIK</h5>

Terrence Malik films are often poetic experiences rather than traditional linear storytelling and with “To the Wonder”, it sounds like he continues to force us to really sit back and think. Or maybe that’s because Ben Affleck’s dialogue got completely cut out and you have no choice. Either way, like any Malik film, you should go in there with an open mind and fresh caffeine running through your veins. I’m still undecided on “Tree of Life”. There were astonishingly potent moments in that film and other’s that struggled to keep my heavy eyelids open. The fact that this film will be available on VOD in April suggests it’s not going to break any box office numbers but if you approach it in a Malik-ready state, you might just get swept away.

<h2 class="no-padding">Upstream Color</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY SHANE CARRUTH</h5>

Shane Carruth who wrote and directed the brilliant “Primer” back in 2004 is back with a new feature, nearly ten years later.  Very positive reviews came out of screenings at this years Sundance and SXSW festivals and Carruth’s flare for originality with everything from his screenplays through to the mise-en-scene will hopefully re-invigorate your cinema senses if having a bad case of 'sequelitis'.

<h2 class="no-padding">Short Term 12</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY DESTIN CRETTON</h5>

Brie Larson has always been awesome in everything she’s been involved with.  From “The United States of Tara”, “21 Jump St” to “Scott Pilgrim”, she always makes a memorable mark on her roles.  Thankfully, someone gave her a lead role this time around in “Short Term 12”. She plays a supervising staff member of a foster care facility who navigates the troubled waters of that world alongside her co-worker and longtime boyfriend.  Rave reviews came out of SXSW this year so expect to see her more and more in the coming years.

<h2 class="no-padding">The Spectacular Now</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY JAMES PONSOLDT</h5>

Although I’ve yet to see “Smashed” starring the great Aaron Paul and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, James Ponsoldt’s next film “The Spectacular Now” has been heralded as a “high-school, coming-of-age comedy drama” which has received some [glowing reviews from Sundance](http://www.slashfilm.com/the-spectacular-now-is-a-great-coming-of-age-movie-that-matters-sundance-2013-review/) earlier in the year. It could be this year’s “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” in the sense of a being an intelligent high-school flick with plenty of heart, drama and humour. Oh and the cast looks fantastic.

<h2 class="no-padding">The Bling Ring</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY SOFIA COPPOLA</h5>

Sofia Coppola needed to bounce back after the extremely disappointing “Somewhere” three years ago.  Luckily, “The Bling Ring” looks much more exciting with a great young cast including Emma Watson (clearly trying to shake her Hermione good-girl image once and for all) and Taissa Farmiga (from *American Horror Story - Season One*) who play a group of fame-obsessed teenagers who use the internet to track celebrities' whereabouts in order to rob their homes.  This is the second film where teenagers go on a crime spree which could fare into predictable waters if it wasn’t for the fact that Coppola is taking the reins.  Also expect a fantastic soundtrack and lots of slow-motion, dancing Emma Watson making suggestive tongue gestures.

<h2 class="no-padding">Only God Forgives</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY NICOLAS WINDING REFN</h5>

“Drive” is easily one of the most loved indie films in the past few years. The low-key comic book superhero story resonated with a generation and now “Drive” director Nicolas Winding Refn and star Ryan Gosling bring their next collaboration to screens before the end of the year. Expect more ultra violence, stylish visual flourishes, a fantastic score and soundtrack and possibly very few words from Gosling. It's set in Bangkok and shit goes down. That's all I know. I’m hopeful this pair can continue their strong artistic partnership and give the audience a seriously strong jolt of adrenaline.

<h2 class="no-padding">Anchorman: The Legend Continues</h2>
<h5 class="film-meta">DIRECTED BY ADAM McKAY</h5>

I guess it was inevitable we would see a sequel to “Anchorman” at some point. Will Ferrell's career has floundered in recent times in terms of box-office numbers and even though the original “Anchorman” didn’t fare significantly in cinemas back in the day, the cult status it’s attained over the years was enough for studios to greenlight a sequel. I love the original and I don’t really see a need for another film because I feel like it might water down the original. That said, these characters are extremely quotable so if the screenplay is good, then I’m sure there will be plenty of new laughs for fans. Casting Kristen Wiig as Brick's love interest is genius. Probably helps to indulge in a little scotchy-scotch beforehand too.
