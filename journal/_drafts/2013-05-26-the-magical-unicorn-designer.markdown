The talk of the 'magical unicorn' designer has been subject to much debate of recent times. 

For the uninitiated, the core concept of the ‘Magical Unicorn’ designer is that an employer hires one designer (or UX’er) expecting to solve all their ‘problems’.  Whilst there are many facets to the discussion, there are some who believe this sort of person doesn’t exist, hence the unicorn aspect and then there’s those that consider it is possible and something that should be embraced as a designer.

Sasha Greif stated in his article [Why Can’t Startups Find Designers](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2012/03/31/why-cant-startups-find-designers/):

> "If you’re looking for a designer who can come up with your identity, design your site, create UIs with great user experience for your web and mobile apps, and on top of that code his or her work in HTML/CSS (and why not throw in Javascript in the mix!), then I’m sorry to inform you that you’re hunting unicorns."

David Cole states in his rebuttal of sorts 
[The Myth of the Myth of the Unicorn Designer](http://irondavy.quora.com/The-Myth-of-the-Myth-of-the-Unicorn-Designer):

> This is wrong. You can observe many talented people who stand as counter examples: Shaun Inman, Kyle Neath, and Justin Ouellette are some of my favorites. More problematically, this argument is the result of numerous bad ideas about learning, definition, and process. Being a long-time generalist designer myself, I feel passionately that this myth is holding back our field and deserves to be debunked.

He also states:

> Would you rather carve a door 1% better than you did last year, or learn how to build the rest of the house in the same amount of time? As I argue below, the connective tissue between these skills may actually be more valuable than incremental gains in a single practice.

A great discussion and well worth reading the entire article.

Mike Monterio who runs [Mule Design](http://www.muledesign.com) and wrote the fantastic [‘Design is a Job’](http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job) recently had [Jared Spool](http://www.uie.com/about/consultants/) on his podcast to discuss the fact that [Unicorns DO Exist!](http://www.muleradio.net/mistakes/89/)

Another must-listen to find out that specialists and generalists are not mutually exclusive.  Perhaps a good discussion on helping break down the black and white notions of the argument.

##Magical Unicorn vs Being a Generalist

First of all, let me get this out of the way — hiring one designer or UX professional to solve all your companies ‘problems’ is inherently a bad idea, no matter the size of the agency/start-up/project.  I’ve covered [this sort of ground before](http://jamessann.com/2013/04/14/the-time-to-adapt-is-now/)  so I don’t want to re-tread too much. But I personally believe it’s bad from all perspectives - the company, the client and the employee. Recently, Paul Boag who has ran the successful web UK agency [Headscape](http://www.headscape.co.uk/) for many years said that [wireframing on your own is kind of pointless](http://boagworld.com/design/wireframe/)[^1]. This is just one of many examples where it’s more effective to work with others rather than trying to solve complex problems on your own.[^2]

However, being a generalist is something that can be effective, depending on the position in your career.  The life-cycle of a designer nowadays is quite varied but here’s how I see it. Please note &mdash; this will vary depending on your pathway but I believe it to be a fair assessment of many digital design paths these days.

##Junior Designer

Perhaps you’re fresh out of University or TAFE, looking for your first job. You could be working as a junior designer at a small agency or start-up or as an intern.  Often, in these positions, a generalist is a strong fit.  They often want multi-skilled designers (or people willing to be) who are good at many tasks because they’re often small, don’t have many staff, and it can be cost effective. You could be designing for print one day, the web next, or wireframing the day after.  If the place is good and has at least one other (more senior) designer working with you, you’ll learn a great deal being a generalist. If the place is supportive, they’ll see failure as something to learn from, not make you feel chastised. So learning as much as possible in many areas might be beneficial at this stage whilst you gain more experience.

As a junior, you might have chosen to go down the freelance route.  Again, being a generalist might be necessary for a while. Ideally, working with other freelancers is likely to be more beneficial in the long run, especially in the web industry. You could end up specialising one day however, gather and work with other specialists, and put together something truly fantastic as a collaboration.  If the collaboration sticks, this could be a lifelong connection and serve you really well.  Some very talented people go down this route from the very beginning and continue to be successful throughout their career. Some move into freelance later in their careers with great success. However many self-employed designers over the years will eventually work for an agency or start-up because it’s really tough making a living freelancing 24/7 for years in the beginning, especially in the web.

##Mid-Weight Designer

A mid-weight designer is quite similar to a junior in some ways. Being a generalist is highly beneficial at this level too and many agencies and start-ups still want good value for money. You’re just better at what you do and perhaps pass on some skills and/or mentorship to a junior so being multi-skilled works well at this stage.

<hr>

##Senior Designer / Lead Designer / Art Director

Once you reach a senior level, being a generalist is still valuable, especially for agencies and start-ups. However, you might start to find your niche a little more (if you haven’t already) and begin thinking of specialising in one or two disciplinary areas. This is where the magical unicorn label starts to appear. It’s where you see job ads looking for these magical unicorns. At this level, many companies are (hopefully) paying you more and so expect more from you. Therefore being a generalist at this stage is still highly advantageous for many companies whilst providing guidance for juniors and mid-weights.

<hr>

##Design Director / Creative Director

These roles typically occur in agencies and start-ups.  You might have mastered many of the skills but you’re also highly creative and ideas driven with a strong sense of marketing and business value.  It often takes years to get there depending on your path and the good ones are highly motivated, experienced, and great with people, both with the staff and particularly clients.  These people can often be described as magical unicorns because they’re so hard to find.  But even then, to expect them to solve all the problems for a company is a mistake.

It’s also a position where the generalist tag starts to disappear for many creative directors because they are no longer just focused on tools but the larger picture (again depending on the size and nature of the organisation).

<hr>

##Consultant / Spokesperson

At this point, you are likely to be a specialist. You might be touring the conference circuit, giving advice to others on your specialised area.  You might even be a senior lecturer at a University. By this stage, you have probably figured out that being a generalist isn't for you anymore (insert subjectivity here). You might also be extremely good at multiple areas of design but more often than not, you're a master in one or two areas and damn good at others.

<hr>

##Closing Thoughts

So whilst I don’t believe in one employee solving a company's ‘problems’ at any point in the career of a designer, there is definite value in being a generalist at certain points. Pathways are varied these days but I will always believe collaboration is the best way forward rather than trying to solve complex issues in isolation. That’s not to say a singular vision isn’t a powerful commodity and whilst you might think doing it all yourself is going to ensure the best result possible, the web is too complex and ever-changing to keep it up over the long-term and deliver the best result possible for a client.

[^1]: Advice like this is invaluable, especially from someone who has been in the business for so long and well respected.

[^2]: Not to be confused with attempting to solve certain problems on your own first, even if they're really, really challenging.
